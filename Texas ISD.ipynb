The payments will come in three installments to employees. The first payment at $1,000 to be dispersed in September, followed by $500 payments at the end of the fall and spring terms. Dr, Young says the payments are to entice current employees to remain with the district as staffing shortages continue. &ldquo;While we&rsquo;re always working to recruit additional employees to our district, retaining the folks we have is the single most important thing we need to do,&rdquo; said Dr. Young. Also shared in the briefing was an upcoming district study to assess the needs of 5th-8th grade students.&nbsp; &nbsp; (13)</p>\n",

A federal judge agreed. A federal judge has ruled that the University of North Texas can&rsquo;t charge out-of-state American students higher tuition than undocumented Texans who qualify for lower in-state tuition under a 2001 Texas law. UNT lawyers appealed last week&rsquo;s decision by U.S. District Judge Sean Jordan, a Trump appointee, over the weekend. If upheld, the decision could impact other Texas public universities, which depend financially on charging higher out-of-state student tuition. The ruling centers on Texas&rsquo; 2001 law allowing undocumented students who have lived in Texas for three years and graduate from a Texas high school to pay in-state tuition. This recent challenge by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, on behalf of the student organization the Young Conservatives of Texas, could provide a new path forward for some Texas lawmakers who have wanted to eliminate the in-state tuition benefit for undocumented students since at least 2015.</p>\n",

Dunbar High School is located in the Stop Six neighborhood of Fort Worth, a majority African American community with many low- or moderate-income residents and a higher-than-average unemployment rate. Some students living and attending school there face a number of economic challenges, including living in fatherless homes. \n",

The payments will come in three installments to employees. The first payment at $1,000 to be dispersed in September, followed by $500 payments at the end of the fall and spring terms. Dr, Young says the payments are to entice current employees to remain with the district as staffing shortages continue. &ldquo;While we&rsquo;re always working to recruit additional employees to our district, retaining the folks we have is the single most important thing we need to do,&rdquo; said Dr. Young. Also shared in the briefing was an upcoming district study to assess the needs of 5th-8th grade students.&nbsp; &nbsp; (13) \n",

A federal judge agreed. A federal judge has ruled that the University of North Texas can&rsquo;t charge out-of-state American students higher tuition than undocumented Texans who qualify for lower in-state tuition under a 2001 Texas law. UNT lawyers appealed last week&rsquo;s decision by U.S. District Judge Sean Jordan, a Trump appointee, over the weekend. If upheld, the decision could impact other Texas public universities, which depend financially on charging higher out-of-state student tuition. The ruling centers on Texas&rsquo; 2001 law allowing undocumented students who have lived in Texas for three years and graduate from a Texas high school to pay in-state tuition. This recent challenge by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, on behalf of the student organization the Young Conservatives of Texas, could provide a new path forward for some Texas lawmakers who have wanted to eliminate the in-state tuition benefit for undocumented students since at least 2015. \n",

Is there any way to protect yourself from the social media gaffe, occasional rant, or outright insubordination that comes from someone knowing they have a contract for another year and saying, so what are you going to do about it now? Termination can be pretty expensive, so let&rsquo;s look at other options to protect the district. \n",

Greg Abbott ordered state education agencies to draw up guidelines for schools to deal with books in their libraries deemed to be \"pornographic,\" the Texas Education Agency - or TEA - has released their policies for schools without a policy of their own to possibly adopt. On Monday, the TEA released a letter to Abbott stating they have created a \"model local school board policy\" for how to deal with discoveries of books they consider to be \"obscene content.\" \"As you noted in your letter, there have been several instances recently of inappropriate materials being found in school libraries. This is unacceptable and the students of Texas should not be exposed to this harmful content in their local schools,\" the letter said. \n",

School districts in the Texas Panhandle and across the state are working on a new playbook for summer school. A conference at Region 16 in Amarillo helped districts plan for the future as more students are in danger of falling behind. &ldquo;COVID-19 really impacted the state of Texas, over 97% of students have some to significant learning loss,&rdquo; said Khara Skidgel, learning leader at Region 16 T-Class High Impact Tutoring. That requires schools to meet the needs of students in a variety of ways. Skidgel conducted a conference to help school districts re-brand summer school as more students are impacted by disruptions resulting in unfinished learning \n",

School districts that spoke to the Chronicle said the problem was lack of funding. But one educator at Sanger ISD, Ann Hughes, has come up with solutions that, largely, do not cost money. Hughes, the district&#39;s director of Social Emotional Learning &amp; Behavior Intervention, breaks down this effort into three tiers. Hughes has more than 30 years of experience in education and is the director of student intervention for Sanger ISD. Hughes has worked in a variety of educational settings, including traditional classrooms, special education classrooms, residential treatment centers, juvenile correctional schools, therapeutic educational day treatment programs and alternative schools. She has a Ph.D. in special education from the University of North Texas. \n",

Manor ISD said around 3:30 p.m., a student was attempting to enter the building through a particular doorway when a teacher denied access. The teacher attempted to redirect the student to another door, but the student refused and pushed past the teacher. The teacher was then seen striking the student several times, the school district said. A Manor ISD police officer saw the incident from a hallway and arrested the teacher. The teacher is being processed at the Travis County Jail. The teacher will be charged with injury to a child. \n",

The payments will come in three installments to employees. The first payment at $1,000 to be dispersed in September, followed by $500 payments at the end of the fall and spring terms. Dr, Young says the payments are to entice current employees to remain with the district as staffing shortages continue. âWhile weâre always working to recruit additional employees to our district, retaining the folks we have is the single most important thing we need to do,â said Dr. Young. Also shared in the briefing was an upcoming district study to assess the needs of 5th-8th grade students.Â  Â  (13)\n",

Education. Look at what the pandemic has done to our kids. One way Texas measures academic progress in public schools is with the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness, a standardized test better known as STAAR. Grades took a hit during the pandemic, leaving teachers with the job of pulling students not just to their grade level, but to the performance level they might have had without the long break in in-person, on-site schooling.Â  Â  (13)\n",

      "           The lawsuit against the University of North Texas argues out-of-state American citizens shouldnât pay more than undocumented Texans. A federal judge agreed. A federal judge has ruled that the University of North Texas canât charge out-of-state American students higher tuition than undocumented Texans who qualify for lower in-state tuition under a 2001 Texas law. UNT lawyers appealed last weekâs decision by U.S. District Judge Sean Jordan, a Trump appointee, over the weekend. If upheld, the decision could impact other Texas public universities, which depend financially on charging higher out-of-state student tuition. The ruling centers on Texasâ 2001 law allowing undocumented students who have lived in Texas for three years and graduate from a Texas high school to pay in-state tuition. This recent challenge by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, on behalf of the student organization the Young Conservatives of Texas, could provide a new path forward for some Texas lawmakers who have wanted to eliminate the in-state tuition benefit for undocumented students since at least 2015.\n",

Dunbar High School is located in the Stop Six neighborhood of Fort Worth, a majority African American community with many low- or moderate-income residents and a higher-than-average unemployment rate. Some students living and attending school there face a number of economic challenges, including living in fatherless homes.\n",

The payments will come in three installments to employees. The first payment at $1,000 to be dispersed in September, followed by $500 payments at the end of the fall and spring terms. Dr, Young says the payments are to entice current employees to remain with the district as staffing shortages continue. âWhile weâre always working to recruit additional employees to our district, retaining the folks we have is the single most important thing we need to do,â said Dr. Young. Also shared in the briefing was an upcoming district study to assess the needs of 5th-8th grade students.Â  Â  (13)\n",

      "                 The lawsuit against the University of North Texas argues out-of-state American citizens shouldnât pay more than undocumented Texans. A federal judge agreed. A federal judge has ruled that the University of North Texas canât charge out-of-state American students higher tuition than undocumented Texans who qualify for lower in-state tuition under a 2001 Texas law. UNT lawyers appealed last weekâs decision by U.S. District Judge Sean Jordan, a Trump appointee, over the weekend. If upheld, the decision could impact other Texas public universities, which depend financially on charging higher out-of-state student tuition. The ruling centers on Texasâ 2001 law allowing undocumented students who have lived in Texas for three years and graduate from a Texas high school to pay in-state tuition. This recent challenge by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, on behalf of the student organization the Young Conservatives of Texas, could provide a new path forward for some Texas lawmakers who have wanted to eliminate the in-state tuition benefit for undocumented students since at least 2015.\n",

School districts in the Texas Panhandle and across the state are working on a new playbook for summer school. A conference at Region 16 in Amarillo helped districts plan for the future as more students are in danger of falling behind. âCOVID-19 really impacted the state of Texas, over 97% of students have some to significant learning loss,â said Khara Skidgel, learning leader at Region 16 T-Class High Impact Tutoring. That requires schools to meet the needs of students in a variety of ways. Skidgel conducted a conference to help school districts re-brand summer school as more students are impacted by disruptions resulting in unfinished learning\n",

School districts that spoke to the Chronicle said the problem was lack of funding. But one educator at Sanger ISD, Ann Hughes, has come up with solutions that, largely, do not cost money. Hughes, the district's director of Social Emotional Learning &amp; Behavior Intervention, breaks down this effort into three tiers. Hughes has more than 30 years of experience in education and is the director of student intervention for Sanger ISD. Hughes has worked in a variety of educational settings, including traditional classrooms, special education classrooms, residential treatment centers, juvenile correctional schools, therapeutic educational day treatment programs and alternative schools. She has a Ph.D. in special education from the University of North Texas.\n",

Chief Financial Officer Johnny Hill anticipates PISD will pay nearly $218 million to the state in mid-2023. This yearâs payment of almost $213 million is projected to give the district the second largest recapture bill in the state, behind only Austin ISD. Hill said PISD could remain second in the state next year, depending on what Houston ISD has to pay.\n",

Manor ISD said around 3:30 p.m., a student was attempting to enter the building through a particular doorway when a teacher denied access. The teacher attempted to redirect the student to another door, but the student refused and pushed past the teacher. The teacher was then seen striking the student several times, the school district said. A Manor ISD police officer saw the incident from a hallway and arrested the teacher. The teacher is being processed at the Travis County Jail. The teacher will be charged with injury to a child.\n",

Due to a long battle with Post-Polio Syndrome the doctor made him hang it up and rest for six months. Never being the kind of person to sit still and also not being the person to listen to his doctor, Joe logged lengthy sessions in front of his PC researching school issues, reading papers and corresponding with his friends and colleagues in the education business.\n",

       " <p><p>ABILENE, Texas (KTAB/KRBC) â In a media briefing Tuesday, Abilene ISD Superintendent Dr. David Youg shared several updates on operations, including $2,000 retention incentive payments approved at Monday nightâs school board meeting. The payments will come in three installments to employees. The first payment at $1,000 to be dispersed in September, followed by $500 payments at the end of the fall and spring terms. Dr, Young says the payments are to entice current employees to remain with the district as staffing shortages continue. âWhile weâre always working to recruit additional employees to our district, retaining the folks we have is the single most important thing we need to do,â said Dr. Young. Also shared in the briefing was an upcoming district study to assess the needs of 5th-8th grade students.Â  Â  (13)</p>\n",

Education. Look at what the pandemic has done to our kids. One way Texas measures academic progress in public schools is with the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness, a standardized test better known as STAAR. Grades took a hit during the pandemic, leaving teachers with the job of pulling students not just to their grade level, but to the performance level they might have had without the long break in in-person, on-site schooling.Â  Â  (13)</p>\n",

       " <p><p>The lawsuit against the University of North Texas argues out-of-state American citizens shouldnât pay more than undocumented Texans. A federal judge agreed. A federal judge has ruled that the University of North Texas canât charge out-of-state American students higher tuition than undocumented Texans who qualify for lower in-state tuition under a 2001 Texas law. UNT lawyers appealed last weekâs decision by U.S. District Judge Sean Jordan, a Trump appointee, over the weekend. If upheld, the decision could impact other Texas public universities, which depend financially on charging higher out-of-state student tuition. The ruling centers on Texasâ 2001 law allowing undocumented students who have lived in Texas for three years and graduate from a Texas high school to pay in-state tuition. This recent challenge by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, on behalf of the student organization the Young Conservatives of Texas, could provide a new path forward for some Texas lawmakers who have wanted to eliminate the in-state tuition benefit for undocumented students since at least 2015.</p>\n",

Dunbar High School is located in the Stop Six neighborhood of Fort Worth, a majority African American community with many low- or moderate-income residents and a higher-than-average unemployment rate.

The payments will come in three installments to employees. The first payment at $1,000 to be dispersed in September, followed by $500 payments at the end of the fall and spring terms. Dr, Young says the payments are to entice current employees to remain with the district as staffing shortages continue. âWhile weâre always working to recruit additional employees to our district, retaining the folks we have is the single most important thing we need to do,â said Dr. Young.

One way Texas measures academic progress in public schools is with the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness, a standardized test better known as STAAR.

       " <p>The lawsuit against the University of North Texas argues out-of-state American citizens shouldnât pay more than undocumented Texans. A federal judge agreed. A federal judge has ruled that the University of North Texas canât charge out-of-state American students higher tuition than undocumented Texans who qualify for lower in-state tuition under a 2001 Texas law. UNT lawyers appealed last weekâs decision by U.S. District Judge Sean Jordan, a Trump appointee, over the weekend. If upheld, the decision could impact other Texas public universities, which depend financially on charging higher out-of-state student tuition. The ruling centers on Texasâ 2001 law allowing undocumented students who have lived in Texas for three years and graduate from a Texas high school to pay in-state tuition. This recent challenge by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, on behalf of the student organization the Young Conservatives of Texas, could provide a new path forward for some Texas lawmakers who have wanted to eliminate the in-state tuition benefit for undocumented students since at least 2015. \n",

Greg Abbott ordered state education agencies to draw up guidelines for schools to deal with books in their libraries deemed to be \"pornographic,\" the Texas Education Agency - or TEA - has released their policies for schools without a policy of their own to possibly adopt. On Monday, the TEA released a letter to Abbott stating they have created a \"model local school board policy\" for how to deal with discoveries of books they consider to be \"obscene content.\" \"As you noted in your letter, there have been several instances recently of inappropriate materials being found in school libraries. This is unacceptable and the students of Texas should not be exposed to this harmful content in their local schools,\" the letter said. \n",

       " <p>AMARILLO, Texas (KVII) â The start of summer school is a few months away. School districts in the Texas Panhandle and across the state are working on a new playbook for summer school. A conference at Region 16 in Amarillo helped districts plan for the future as more students are in danger of falling behind. âCOVID-19 really impacted the state of Texas, over 97% of students have some to significant learning loss,â said Khara Skidgel, learning leader at Region 16 T-Class High Impact Tutoring. That requires schools to meet the needs of students in a variety of ways. Skidgel conducted a conference to help school districts re-brand summer school as more students are impacted by disruptions resulting in unfinished learning \n",

School districts that spoke to the Chronicle said the problem was lack of funding. But one educator at Sanger ISD, Ann Hughes, has come up with solutions that, largely, do not cost money. Hughes, the district's director of Social Emotional Learning &amp; Behavior Intervention, breaks down this effort into three tiers. Hughes has more than 30 years of experience in education and is the director of student intervention for Sanger ISD. Hughes has worked in a variety of educational settings, including traditional classrooms, special education classrooms, residential treatment centers, juvenile correctional schools, therapeutic educational day treatment programs and alternative schools. She has a Ph.D. in special education from the University of North Texas. \n",

Due to a long battle with Post-Polio Syndrome the doctor made him hang it up and rest for six months. Never being the kind of person to sit still and also not being the person to listen to his doctor, Joe logged lengthy sessions in front of his PC researching school issues, reading papers and corresponding with his friends and colleagues in the education business.</p>\n",

The payments will come in three installments to employees. The first payment at $1,000 to be dispersed in September, followed by $500 payments at the end of the fall and spring terms. Dr, Young says the payments are to entice current employees to remain with the district as staffing shortages continue. âWhile weâre always working to recruit additional employees to our district, retaining the folks we have is the single most important thing we need to do,â said Dr. Young. Also shared in the briefing was an upcoming district study to assess the needs of 5th-8th grade students.Â  Â  (13)</p>\n",

One way Texas measures academic progress in public schools is with the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness, a standardized test better known as STAAR.

       " <p><p>The lawsuit against the University of North Texas argues out-of-state American citizens shouldnât pay more than undocumented Texans. A federal judge agreed. A federal judge has ruled that the University of North Texas canât charge out-of-state American students higher tuition than undocumented Texans who qualify for lower in-state tuition under a 2001 Texas law. UNT lawyers appealed last weekâs decision by U.S. District Judge Sean Jordan, a Trump appointee, over the weekend. If upheld, the decision could impact other Texas public universities, which depend financially on charging higher out-of-state student tuition. The ruling centers on Texasâ 2001 law allowing undocumented students who have lived in Texas for three years and graduate from a Texas high school to pay in-state tuition. This recent challenge by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, on behalf of the student organization the Young Conservatives of Texas, could provide a new path forward for some Texas lawmakers who have wanted to eliminate the in-state tuition benefit for undocumented students since at least 2015.</p>\n",

The payments will come in three installments to employees. The first payment at $1,000 to be dispersed in September, followed by $500 payments at the end of the fall and spring terms. Dr, Young says the payments are to entice current employees to remain with the district as staffing shortages continue. âWhile weâre always working to recruit additional employees to our district, retaining the folks we have is the single most important thing we need to do,â said Dr. Young.

       " <p>The lawsuit against the University of North Texas argues out-of-state American citizens shouldnât pay more than undocumented Texans. A federal judge agreed. A federal judge has ruled that the University of North Texas canât charge out-of-state American students higher tuition than undocumented Texans who qualify for lower in-state tuition under a 2001 Texas law. UNT lawyers appealed last weekâs decision by U.S. District Judge Sean Jordan, a Trump appointee, over the weekend. If upheld, the decision could impact other Texas public universities, which depend financially on charging higher out-of-state student tuition. The ruling centers on Texasâ 2001 law allowing undocumented students who have lived in Texas for three years and graduate from a Texas high school to pay in-state tuition. This recent challenge by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, on behalf of the student organization the Young Conservatives of Texas, could provide a new path forward for some Texas lawmakers who have wanted to eliminate the in-state tuition benefit for undocumented students since at least 2015. \n",

School districts that spoke to the Chronicle said the problem was lack of funding. But one educator at Sanger ISD, Ann Hughes, has come up with solutions that, largely, do not cost money. Hughes, the district's director of Social Emotional Learning &amp; Behavior Intervention, breaks down this effort into three tiers. Hughes has more than 30 years of experience in education and is the director of student intervention for Sanger ISD. Hughes has worked in a variety of educational settings, including traditional classrooms, special education classrooms, residential treatment centers, juvenile correctional schools, therapeutic educational day treatment programs and alternative schools.

This yearâs payment of almost $213 million is projected to give the district the second largest recapture bill in the state, behind only Austin ISD.

Manor ISD said around 3:30 p.m., a student was attempting to enter the building through a particular doorway when a teacher denied access. The teacher attempted to redirect the student to another door, but the student refused and pushed past the teacher. The teacher was then seen striking the student several times, the school district said. A Manor ISD police officer saw the incident from a hallway and arrested the teacher. The teacher is being processed at the Travis County Jail. The teacher will be charged with injury to a child. \n",

       " \tTexasISD.com was the brainchild of Joe F. Smith. Joe retired early from a successful career as Superintendent of Schools for Hudson ISD, deep in the Piney Woods of East Texas. Due to a long battle with Post-Polio Syndrome the doctor made him hang it up and rest for six months. Never being the kind of person to sit still and also not being the person to listen to his doctor, Joe logged lengthy sessions in front of his PC researching school issues, reading papers and corresponding with his friends and colleagues in the education business.</p>\n",

The payments will come in three installments to employees. The first payment at $1,000 to be dispersed in September, followed by $500 payments at the end of the fall and spring terms. Dr, Young says the payments are to entice current employees to remain with the district as staffing shortages continue. âWhile weâre always working to recruit additional employees to our district, retaining the folks we have is the single most important thing we need to do,â said Dr. Young. Also shared in the briefing was an upcoming district study to assess the needs of 5th-8th grade students.Â  Â  (13)</p>\n",

Education. Look at what the pandemic has done to our kids. One way Texas measures academic progress in public schools is with the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness, a standardized test better known as STAAR. Grades took a hit during the pandemic, leaving teachers with the job of pulling students not just to their grade level, but to the performance level they might have had without the long break in in-person, on-site schooling.Â  Â  (13)</p>\n",

       " <p><p>The lawsuit against the University of North Texas argues out-of-state American citizens shouldnât pay more than undocumented Texans. A federal judge agreed. A federal judge has ruled that the University of North Texas canât charge out-of-state American students higher tuition than undocumented Texans who qualify for lower in-state tuition under a 2001 Texas law. UNT lawyers appealed last weekâs decision by U.S. District Judge Sean Jordan, a Trump appointee, over the weekend. If upheld, the decision could impact other Texas public universities, which depend financially on charging higher out-of-state student tuition. The ruling centers on Texasâ 2001 law allowing undocumented students who have lived in Texas for three years and graduate from a Texas high school to pay in-state tuition. This recent challenge by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, on behalf of the student organization the Young Conservatives of Texas, could provide a new path forward for some Texas lawmakers who have wanted to eliminate the in-state tuition benefit for undocumented students since at least 2015.</p>\n",

Dunbar High School is located in the Stop Six neighborhood of Fort Worth, a majority African American community with many low- or moderate-income residents and a higher-than-average unemployment rate.

The payments will come in three installments to employees. The first payment at $1,000 to be dispersed in September, followed by $500 payments at the end of the fall and spring terms. Dr, Young says the payments are to entice current employees to remain with the district as staffing shortages continue. âWhile weâre always working to recruit additional employees to our district, retaining the folks we have is the single most important thing we need to do,â said Dr. Young. Also shared in the briefing was an upcoming district study to assess the needs of 5th-8th grade students.Â  Â  (13) \n",

One way Texas measures academic progress in public schools is with the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness, a standardized test better known as STAAR.

A federal judge has ruled that the University of North Texas canât charge out-of-state American students higher tuition than undocumented Texans who qualify for lower in-state tuition under a 2001 Texas law. UNT lawyers appealed last weekâs decision by U.S. District Judge Sean Jordan, a Trump appointee, over the weekend. If upheld, the decision could impact other Texas public universities, which depend financially on charging higher out-of-state student tuition. The ruling centers on Texasâ 2001 law allowing undocumented students who have lived in Texas for three years and graduate from a Texas high school to pay in-state tuition. This recent challenge by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, on behalf of the student organization the Young Conservatives of Texas, could provide a new path forward for some Texas lawmakers who have wanted to eliminate the in-state tuition benefit for undocumented students since at least 2015. \n",

A conference at Region 16 in Amarillo helped districts plan for the future as more students are in danger of falling behind. âCOVID-19 really impacted the state of Texas, over 97% of students have some to significant learning loss,â said Khara Skidgel, learning leader at Region 16 T-Class High Impact Tutoring. That requires schools to meet the needs of students in a variety of ways.

School districts that spoke to the Chronicle said the problem was lack of funding. But one educator at Sanger ISD, Ann Hughes, has come up with solutions that, largely, do not cost money. Hughes, the district's director of Social Emotional Learning &amp; Behavior Intervention, breaks down this effort into three tiers. Hughes has more than 30 years of experience in education and is the director of student intervention for Sanger ISD. Hughes has worked in a variety of educational settings, including traditional classrooms, special education classrooms, residential treatment centers, juvenile correctional schools, therapeutic educational day treatment programs and alternative schools. She has a Ph.D. in special education from the University of North Texas. \n",

Due to a long battle with Post-Polio Syndrome the doctor made him hang it up and rest for six months. Never being the kind of person to sit still and also not being the person to listen to his doctor, Joe logged lengthy sessions in front of his PC researching school issues, reading papers and corresponding with his friends and colleagues in the education business.</p>\n",

The payments will come in three installments to employees. The first payment at $1,000 to be dispersed in September, followed by $500 payments at the end of the fall and spring terms. Dr, Young says the payments are to entice current employees to remain with the district as staffing shortages continue. âWhile weâre always working to recruit additional employees to our district, retaining the folks we have is the single most important thing we need to do,â said Dr. Young. Also shared in the briefing was an upcoming district study to assess the needs of 5th-8th grade students.\\xa0 \\xa0 (13)\\n\\n\\nSalado Independent School District expected to run as normal after Tuesdayâs tornado \\n\\n\\nSALADO, Texas â The superintendent from Salado Independent School District sent out a message to students and their families Tuesday afternoon via Facebook after a tornado hit the area. In the message, Superintendent Michael Novotny expressed that school facilities were okay and classes were expected to run as normal, however absences would be excused for students affected by the storm.\\xa0 Blackburn said a total of 23 people were injured. Of the 23, one person was taken to the hospital in critical condition while 12 people were taken to the hospital with injuries; the other 11 were treated and released, he said.\\xa0 \"We believe we have everyone accounted for, but we are double and triple checking that this evening,\" Blackburn added.\\xa0 \\xa0 (13)\\n\\n\\nDelays, closures and chaos mount at Texas-Mexico border crossings from new state inspections \\n\\n\\nEL PASO â Joel Estebaneâs commercial truck had already been inspected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers after crossing the bridge that connects Ciudad JuÃ¡rez and El Paso on Tuesday afternoon â then he had to wait another hour in another line where Texas state troopers were questioning commercial drivers.\\xa0 Estebane, who was on his way to pick up office and paper supplies from El Paso to haul to JuÃ¡rez, said it took six hours to get his truck through El Pasoâs port of entry. Troopers had set up a state inspection site next to a condominium complex and the local zoo where they stopped and questioned truck drivers about their cargo.\\xa0 \\xa0 (13)\\n\\n\\nAnalysis: Texas schools need support from politically distracted state leaders \\n\\n\\nWhile the stateâs top political performers are talking about books in school libraries, and about whether history teachers ought to be allowed to teach history, Texas schools â schools everywhere, really â are up against a daunting fundamental problem. Education. Look at what the pandemic has done to our kids. One way Texas measures academic progress in public schools is with the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness, a standardized test better known as STAAR. Grades took a hit during the pandemic, leaving teachers with the job of pulling students not just to their grade level, but to the performance level they might have had without the long break in in-person, on-site schooling.\\xa0 \\xa0 (13)\\n\\n\\nSchools cancel, delay classes after Tuesday storm \\n\\n\\nTYLER, Texas (KETK) â A few East Texas school districts have decided to cancel or delay classes following yet another round of severe weather Tuesday night.\\xa0 Most of the schools listed below have canceled due to a lack of power on their campuses. This list will be updated as more schools are added. Check back for updates.\\xa0 \\xa0 (13)\\n\\n\\nFederal judge rules UNT canât charge out-of-state students more tuition than undocumented students \\n\\n\\nThe lawsuit against the University of North Texas argues out-of-state American citizens shouldnât pay more than undocumented Texans. A federal judge agreed. A federal judge has ruled that the University of North Texas canât charge out-of-state American students higher tuition than undocumented Texans who qualify for lower in-state tuition under a 2001 Texas law. UNT lawyers appealed last weekâs decision by U.S. District Judge Sean Jordan, a Trump appointee, over the weekend. If upheld, the decision could impact other Texas public universities, which depend financially on charging higher out-of-state student tuition. The ruling centers on Texasâ 2001 law allowing undocumented students who have lived in Texas for three years and graduate from a Texas high school to pay in-state tuition. This recent challenge by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, on behalf of the student organization the Young Conservatives of Texas, could provide a new path forward for some Texas lawmakers who have wanted to eliminate the in-state tuition benefit for undocumented students since at least 2015.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNews Category\\n\\nAccountability/Accreditation\\nCharter Schools\\nChild Nutrition\\nConstruction/Bond Issues\\nGovernance\\nGrants\\nHealth/Safety\\nJoe\\'s Commentaries\\nLegal\\nLegislative\\nNational News\\nNewspapers\\nPersonnel\\nProperty Tax\\nRisk Management\\nSchool Finance\\nSpecial Articles\\nState Board of Education\\nSuperSearch Page\\nTechnology in Education\\nTexasISD General News\\nTransportation\\nPreventive Law\\n\\n\\n\\nSubmit Info!\\nTexasISD.com Endorsed Products\\nTexasISD.com Advertising\\n\\nTexasISD.com Quick Links\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHome Â»  \\nToday\\'s News\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nJoeâs Commentary: Defining the Future\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t              \\t    April 1109:00 AM\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI continue to stress the importance of registering to vote and, following that, the significance of actually carrying through and going to the polls in the May 7 election.

Recognizing this and understanding that students living without a dad are at greater risk of major life challenges than those who grow up with a father at home, Witherite Law Group and Fort Worth ISD Family Action Center have partnered to sponsor the Dads of Dunbar Mentoring program at Dunbar High School. Dunbar High School is located in the Stop Six neighborhood of Fort Worth, a majority African American community with many low- or moderate-income residents and a higher-than-average unemployment rate.

A federal judge agreed. A federal judge has ruled that the University of North Texas canât charge out-of-state American students higher tuition than undocumented Texans who qualify for lower in-state tuition under a 2001 Texas law. UNT lawyers appealed last weekâs decision by U.S. District Judge Sean Jordan, a Trump appointee, over the weekend. If upheld, the decision could impact other Texas public universities, which depend financially on charging higher out-of-state student tuition. The ruling centers on Texasâ 2001 law allowing undocumented students who have lived in Texas for three years and graduate from a Texas high school to pay in-state tuition. This recent challenge by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, on behalf of the student organization the Young Conservatives of Texas, could provide a new path forward for some Texas lawmakers who have wanted to eliminate the in-state tuition benefit for undocumented students since at least 2015. \\n                                        \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t     \\t\\t                                            \\n                                                                                             view article \\xa0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTexas Education Agencyâs new school library standards push for more scrutiny and parental input\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t     April 1205:00 AM\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nSchool districts are not required to adopt the agencyâs recommendations but can use them as guidance as they develop new procedures or alter their policies for selecting or removing library books.\\xa0 The Texas Education Agency\\xa0released statewide standards\\xa0Monday for how school districts should remove and prevent âobscene contentâ from entering Texas public school libraries.\\xa0 In the agencyâs model policy, there is an emphasis that parents should have a role in how books are selected.

School districts in the Texas Panhandle and across the state are working on a new playbook for summer school. A conference at Region 16 in Amarillo helped districts plan for the future as more students are in danger of falling behind. âCOVID-19 really impacted the state of Texas, over 97% of students have some to significant learning loss,â said Khara Skidgel, learning leader at Region 16 T-Class High Impact Tutoring. That requires schools to meet the needs of students in a variety of ways. Skidgel conducted a conference to help school districts re-brand summer school as more students are impacted by disruptions resulting in unfinished learning \\n                                        \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t     \\t\\t                                            \\n                                                                                             view article \\xa0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow can schools provide mental health services for students?

School districts that spoke to the Chronicle said the problem was lack of funding. But one educator at Sanger ISD, Ann Hughes, has come up with solutions that, largely, do not cost money. Hughes, the district\\'s director of Social Emotional Learning & Behavior Intervention, breaks down this effort into three tiers. Hughes has more than 30 years of experience in education and is the director of student intervention for Sanger ISD. Hughes has worked in a variety of educational settings, including traditional classrooms, special education classrooms, residential treatment centers, juvenile correctional schools, therapeutic educational day treatment programs and alternative schools.
